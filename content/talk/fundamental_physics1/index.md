# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "Workers and peasants choked up on running and displacement. Theory and practice made us choose to shout for workers and peasants. When the light is far away, we are willing to shoulder the burden of inheritance; when the darkness is still there, we are willing to turn into sparks in the sky! The reality tells us that the road ahead is still bumpy, but it is also the bumps that make every young man who evokes ideals gradually join us, making us stronger and more mature; it is also the bumps that make us better understand the meaning of fighting and go to the vast. The world, stand with workers and peasants! We are left-wing youth, we are the children of workers and peasants."

What is the purpose of writing this article? I think the time to write may be early or too late. I think it might be for a bit of forgotten remembrance, to give myself a little psychological comfort, and to provide a signpost for my future.

I want to talk about my personal past life first. I have been wasted for twenty years. I am not very happy at school or with my parents. I am confused about the meaning of life. After I arrive at university, I think I may really feel a little bit of the meaning of my life. In school, or on the Internet, it makes me feel a joy which helping others and communicating with others. And this is not only a pleasure, but also a sense of beauty for me. But I still have many shortcomings, flaws, and psychological problems. I just hope I can get better in the future. That's it, I don't want myself to be as mean, cowardly, and cowardly, and I don't want to be as sophisticated as the so-called adults.
