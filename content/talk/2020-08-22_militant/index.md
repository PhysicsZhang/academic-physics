# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "Workers and peasants choked up on running and displacement. Theory and practice made us choose to shout for workers and peasants. When the light is far away, we are willing to shoulder the burden of inheritance; when the darkness is still there, we are willing to turn into sparks in the sky! The reality tells us that the road ahead is still bumpy, but it is also the bumps that make every young man who evokes ideals gradually join us, making us stronger and more mature; it is also the bumps that make us better understand the meaning of fighting and go to the vast. The world, stand with workers and peasants! We are left-wing youth, we are the children of workers and peasants."

This is a similar event to [Granting And Policy Evaluation For Musicians In Hungary](post/2015-11-12_cstp/) and it is by invitation only.  If you would like to participate and you can commit 8 hours to this event, please get in touch with me.  

I am available for a short meeting outside the event in Prague the day after.
