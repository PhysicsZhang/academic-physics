# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "Workers and peasants choked up on running and displacement. Theory and practice made us choose to shout for workers and peasants. When the light is far away, we are willing to shoulder the burden of inheritance; when the darkness is still there, we are willing to turn into sparks in the sky! The reality tells us that the road ahead is still bumpy, but it is also the bumps that make every young man who evokes ideals gradually join us, making us stronger and more mature; it is also the bumps that make us better understand the meaning of fighting and go to the vast. The world, stand with workers and peasants! We are left-wing youth, we are the children of workers and peasants."

What is the purpose of writing this article? I think the time to write may be early or too late. I think it might be for a bit of forgotten remembrance, to give myself a little psychological comfort, and to provide a signpost for my future.
I want to talk about my personal past life first. I have been wasted for twenty years. I am not very happy at school or with my parents. I am confused about the meaning of life. After I arrive at university, I think I may really feel a little bit of the meaning of my life. In school, or on the Internet, it makes me feel a joy which helping others and communicating with others. And this is not only a pleasure, but also a sense of beauty for me. But I still have many shortcomings, flaws, and psychological problems. I just hope I can get better in the future. That's it, I don't want myself to be as mean, cowardly, and cowardly, and I don't want to be as sophisticated as the so-called adults.
For society other than myself, I would like to tell three stories as examples. The first story is a big brother I met online. He should work for China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation(中船重工). Judging from his online speeches, he should be said to be very indignant. He cannot understand foreigners and ethnic minorities and feels that they have too many privileges. According to the labels on the Internet, he should be an huanghan(皇汉) and an gongyedang(工业党). But then one day he posted a post. He said that he followed the leader to attend a political and business meeting and met some ministerial leaders and some businessmen. At that meeting, he heard ministerial leaders say that people who worry about the country and the people like him on the Internet are nothing more than so-called clowns. He expressed a sense of loss in the post, saying, "He has seen it clearly, from the past and present. The fundamental contradiction is the contradiction between the Zhao clan(赵族) and the Diaosi clan(屌丝族)." I think he may have realized who gave these privileges that he was indignant before. He finally said that he believed no one but Chairman Mao, and expressed his resentment. Two or three months later, he stopped speaking online. I never saw him again.
Second, let me talk about a friend I met in the QQ group. He should be the senior of the School of Mathematics of PKU. He participated in a mathematics seminar organized by Tian Gang(田刚) in 2018. Originally, he only studied mathematics. Unfortunately, he joined a club again. This club disappeared for some reasons. Of course, it could not be called out. It should be said that it was reorganized. Looking at his speech in the QQ group, he still missed that experience very much. He felt that he had done all four years of college in that six months, and he felt that he finally met some people, not only in the story. But then he gradually became depressed. In the middle of the night, he was alone in the QQ group, regardless of others, sending many messages by himself. Later, he quit the group by himself because of a conflict with the group leader. I never saw him again.
Third, There is also an old woman. I was on the bus. I heard her call. She was from a rural area. She came to Zhengzhou(郑州) to work alone. I don’t know why in the countryside. It seems that the land of her has been occupied by some people, and then the folks in the village. They all went to court together, and she and her husband were among them, but her husband and other people who went to court with him gradually passed away in the process. The old woman mentioned her daughter. After finishing her undergraduate degree, her daughter stopped studying for a master's degree because she had no money. She went to Shanghai(上海) to work alone. Four people lived in a rental house. The daughter was very sensible. For a salary, a person has to teach herself to take an accounting certificate. She told her interlocutor that she must take care of her health and must persist until the lawsuit is won. Then she said that she made a lot of money as a cleaner in the city by herself. Get out of the car. I never saw her again.
I gave three examples. It’s not that they are particularly miserable. I know that there are even more painful and miserable experiences in China and the world. I just want to ask, what doctrines or forces on the Internet can help them and Solve their problems? Then I am very grateful. It should be said that the paradox of the current social situation puzzles me and is a driving force for my criticism.
To criticize and fight, then how should we understand criticism? I personally think that criticism is the core of Marxism, and it can also be said that the rebellion is justified and the revolution is innocent. Marxists should not be satisfied with the status quo, but should find the bad factors hidden in the status quo to change it. So does Marxism support all criticism? no. I personally think that the criticism supported by Marxism should be based on two basic principles: one is seeking truth from facts and the other is revolutionary humanitarianism.(革命人道主义)
Seeking truth from facts means that we must respect the facts and explore the objective laws behind things. This is a general understanding principle. In understanding with all the people involved, we must also involve the issue of value judgment, that is to say, is one thing well done? Shouldn't it? The standard of Marxists is revolutionary humanitarianism. It should be said that liberals also support humanitarianism, but what they support can be called liberal humanitarianism, which is somewhat different from our revolutionary humanitarian principles. One of the differences is that liberals mostly oppose revolution and bid farewell to revolution, while Marxists do not. We support revolution and are willing to actively guide revolution.
Going back to criticism, there are two forms of criticism, one is ideological and theoretical criticism, and the other is practical criticism. The two cannot be substituted for each other. We should give consideration to these two criticisms, especially in the field of human society. We cannot understand Marxism as a learning in the study, but as a learning developed in the international communist movement. When the international communist movement is booming, Marxism rises , and when the international communist movement declines, and Marxism declines. We Marxists must actively practice in the field of human society, and at the current stage, it means class struggle. Of course, due to historical reasons, Marxism now generally includes not only these two basic principles, but also richer content, such as philosophy and political economy. We need to learn from the previous Marxists' related expositions on philosophy and political economy, but at the same time, we should not limit Marxist vision to the fields of philosophy and political economy, but should understand it as general epistemological principles and expand their application To the entire field.
Here I also want to talk about how to criticize and fight in real life. In fact, the predecessors left us many valuable experiences and many painful lessons. Ronggong(融工), standing with the workers and peasants is the basic point. Nowadays, many people are worried about "reverse training(逆练)". I don't think they need to be afraid. The masses are on the side of justice. As long as we do our work well and really unite the masses, then there is no need to worry about "reverse training(逆练)" by the rightists. To do things, politically, I think an important basic point is that we must first have our own organization, and there must be an organization to talk about. Who is our enemy? Who are our friends? Only then can we unite most people to develop their own strength. Now even we don’t know who we are? The enemy doesn't know who we are? Anyone can be us, and we can be anyone. Perhaps this is a problem with current online identity politics. Of course, the organization we build should be young, militant, and full of vitality. It should absorb the shortcomings of the past organization and not conduct some behavior that violates the humanitarian principles of the revolution in order to develop our strength. In the modern capitalist society, facing all aspects of capitalism's invasion and corrosion on us, it is even more necessary for us to maintain a critical perspective on everything in our lives at all times, to think with our own minds, and not to get bourgeoisie style.
I also want to review myself. I have always been afraid of taking responsibility in the past. I am used to my past life. I don't want to go to school or grow up. I must criticize myself and change. The greatest pain in life is that there is nowhere to go after waking up from a dream. I can’t forget this sentence. Because of this, people will say things that they don't believe, want to stay in a dream but don't want to wake up, and want to pretend to sleep but cannot pretend to sleep. Still living in a dream is a good thing, but waking up from a dream should also be a decision without hesitation. What is a dream? It is a continuation of reality. Where is my reality? That is the end of the dream. I woke up, but confused and melancholy, thinking about how to eat in an age when people are not human. When you wake up, you should no longer obey social disciplines, and you should no longer escape from nothingness. But, how do we go on? I don’t know this now. So many people better than me have failed. What qualifications do I have to say that I can win? I really admire the former revolutionaries for being able to maintain their revolutionary fighting spirit. I think even if they sacrifice, they must be happy to imagine a bright future! But who can we now, and who dare to point out a way? We walked the past road, knowing that there was a problem with the past road, and even suffered a huge blow. where is the road? No one knows now. But is this over? I am not satisfied. The road does not matter whether it is there or nothing; hope is that it does not matter whether there is or it does not matter. When there is existence, there is hope. You must first find an existence. The way forward is determined by the people. I think that if there are more people walking, there will naturally be a way. Well, I wake up earlier than others, and I should help others to do something, start with my feet first, and explore the way first. The cause of the revolution depends on everyone, and I can do something. Don't feel helpless because of the momentary failure. Don't feel that learning is useless. Indeed, learning cannot solve all problems, but learning also pave the way for future construction.
    In 2017 and 2018, I was deeply impressed. There will be times when long winds and waves will sail straight on the clouds to help the sea(长风破浪会有时，直挂云帆济沧海). I dare not say much now, nor can I point out the way for others. I just hope that we can improve by one point now, and work hard for one point. Do you perish in silence, or be a militant youth? Between the two paths, we must make a choice.
