This is a similar event to [Granting And Policy Evaluation For Musicians In Hungary](post/2015-11-12_cstp/) and it is by invitation only.  If you would like to participate and you can commit 8 hours to this event, please get in touch with me.  

I am available for a short meeting outside the event in Prague the day after.
